= pct-compose

Declare all your LXC containers from a single file. Deploy them using `pct-compose`.

== Some context and warnings

This utility was developped for my personal use (a little homelab with one proxmox node).
I didn't want to manage a K8S cluster, I was discovering Nix and its capability to generate LXC containers easily, and I wanted to automatically refresh my containers with no more concepts and tools involved than pct and nix (usage of nix is not covered here).
So this tool should be maintained as long as I use it, and would not have too much features.

== Requirements

 * At least one Proxmox node

== Installation

[source, bash]
----
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/pct-compose https://github.com/scarisey/pct-compose/releases/download/0.5.0/pct-compose
